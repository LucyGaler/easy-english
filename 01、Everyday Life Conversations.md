### Studying Abroad

Hey, I haven't seen you in a while. Where were you?

I went to South Korea to join an exchange student program.

You went to South Korea？

Yeah, I applied for the program at the Scholarship office of our university and I got accepted.

What were you studying?

Korean language.

Where did you stay?

I stayed at Seoul National University on the campus.

At like dorms or something?

Yeah.

Wow, were they nice?

Very nice. Better than ours.

How long were you there?

I was there for 10 months.

That's a really long time.

Yeah.

Did you get homesick?

A little.

What are the South Korean people like?

Typically, they will avoid talking to foreigners. But if you need help, they are very nice and would go out of their way to help you. Appearance means everything in Korea - your hairstyle, dress sense, the shoes that you're wearing. They love to look trendy. They are incredibly respectful to their elders. If there's even a one year difference in age, they'll make sure that the elder is respected properly.

Really? That's so interesting. What did you do there other than studying?

I visited a lot of attractions like palaces, museums, parks, markets and temples. Seoul is unlike any other city that I have visited.

Did you have any difficulties getting around?

Not at all. The public transportation in Seoul is excellent.

What did you think of the food?

The food was good to begin with, it has its own kind of spices. They use pepper paste and pepper vinegar in a lot of their foods. They eat a lot of seafood like squid, octopus, shrimp  and crab.

And rice, I suppose, right?

Yes, of course, rice, too.

I particularly liked a dish of vegetables, egg and noodles mixed together. They also have a traditional side dish of salted and fermented vegetables called Kimchi which is served at nearly every meal. Food was very, very cheap and clothing was cheap on the outskirts of the city where the university was.

Cool. What was the highlight of your trip?

The best part of my trip was probably the cruise along the Han River when I got to see all the great buildings at night. It was very beautiful. The night view was unbelievable and I was able to have dinner while admiring the view of the Han River. I could also enjoy a live musical band on board, which was lovely. It was one of the unforgettable experiences I had in Korea.

Wow. Did you have any problems during your stay there?

No, I didn't have any problems. I thought all the people were very nice and I really had a good time.

Can you speak Korean now?

Yes, I picked up a lot of words and phrases. I enjoyed being abroad for 10 months. It was a nice experience to get out and live somewhere else.

go out of their way : make a special effort

### Giving Advice 1

How's your son, Nicole? He's 25 now, right?

That's right, he's 25. Well, he's a firefighter now.

Does he still live with you and your husband?

Yes, he does. He says he can't afford to rent an apartment, because it's too expensive and he doesn't earn enough money. He gives us some money every month for bills and, you know,  it's nice to have him at home, but we’d like him to be more independent. He told us a few days ago that he's planning a two-week vacation to Canada with his friends. I mean, it's true that he works full-time and we know he needs a break. But we think he should save his money so that he can get his own place to live. Should we talk him out of going to Canada?

You know, to be honest, I think you're being a bit hard on him. I mean, he's only twenty-five. It's good that he has a job, and everybody needs a vacation. My advice is that you should let him go to Canada, and when he comes back, you should sit down with him and talk to him about starting to pay rent. That way he'll understand that he needs to start planning for the future and to start thinking about renting an apartment. There are a lot of young people still living at home in their 20s(twenties) and 30s(thirties), and some of them don't even have jobs. So in many ways, I think you're lucky.

Yeah, you make a point.

talk him out of : persuade someone not to do something

you make a point : I agree with you

------

### Giving Advice 2

I've got a problem, Maria and I need your advice.

Sure. What's your problem?

Well, a month ago, my friend Claudia and I decided to go on vacation together to Los Angeles. So we planned everything and I was really looking forward to it, as Claudia's an old friend and I don't see her very often. But the other day, she told me that she invited another friend of hers - somebody I don't know, a girl called Phoebe - to come with us. Claudia never asked me what I thought. I don't even know Phoebe and I really don't want to go on vacation with someone I don't know. What should I do?

I think it was kind of thoughtless of her to invite Phoebe without telling you and she's put you in a difficult position. You have several different options. You could say that you aren't going if Phoebe goes. Or you could just cancel and suggest having another vacation later, with just the two of you. Or you could invite someone else who you like, and then there would be four of you. But in fact, you might like Phoebe, maybe she's a nice person. So, I think you should try to get to know her first. If you like her, then the vacation will probably be a success. If not, then you should tell your friend you aren't going because you don't think it'll work with Phoebe.

Okay, I'll give it a shot. I’ll try to get acquainted with Phoebe first and see if we can get along. Thanks for the advice.

get acquainted : get to know each other

### Mike’s Jobs

What kind of jobs have you had so far, Mike?

Well, the first job that I can remember was in high school. I had a part-time job working at a fast food restaurant.

Really?

Yeah, I started out as a cashier, and mostly on the weekends. And after a couple of years, I got to be Manager, so all the way through university I worked there.

Did you like it?

Yes, a lot of my friends were working there so that made it a lot of fun. But when I graduated from university, I really wanted to get a job in my field so I got a job as an economist after that.

An economist?

Yeah, I worked as an economist for a little over 2 years, and I didn't really like that job, it was so boring. On top of that, I didn't get along with my boss. He was always asking me to work overtime. I didn't really like the atmosphere there, so I quit.

What did you do after that?

After that I wasn't sure what to do. I went back to Phoenix and stayed with my parents for a while. Then I got a quick job at a grocery store. I only got the job because I was broke and needed a little dough to live on before moving on. I thought it was hilarious that this grocery store made me go through some lengthy training and orientation, so I could stock dairy and do super basic customer service.

Was it full-time?

Yeah, it was full-time. In the meantime, I went back to university and I got my Master's degree in English.

That's great. So you became an English teacher?

Yes, I read in a magazine about a job teaching English overseas in Thailand. So I applied for that job and I got it.

Thailand. Did you like that job?

Yeah, that was a very interesting job. I mean, it was my first time overseas, and it was my first time teaching. So I really enjoyed it. And I liked the students a lot. But I just had a one-year contract and certain aspects of living in Thailand were difficult. So after my contract was finished, I came back to the US and continued to teach English here. I needed to try and fail to figure out what I'm good at and what I like. The more experiences I was exposed to, the more I learned.

all the way through university : 在大学期间 

On top of that : 最重要的是，除此之外

### Talking about Rumors

Sam, have you heard Ron might be fired soon?

No, I had no idea. I wonder what happened.

Have you ever worked with him?

Yes, I worked with him last year, and I've heard stories about him for years.

I've never worked with him directly, but I know people that have, and they say he was always shouting and screaming, threatening to fire people. And Martha told me he took credit for one of her ideas. She had this idea for a project, and she brought it up at a meeting and he liked it. He made her do all the work planning it, then when the project actually got started Martha was left out of it, and her name was not mentioned anywhere.

I heard the project won an award because it was brilliant.

That's right. Martha saw red when she heard about the award, because she didn't get the credit she deserved. But she couldn't do anything. Her hands were tied.

Yeah, Ron would have fired her if she had dared to report him. It must be a really bad feeling to have your ideas stolen.

How did you find working with him?

It was a nightmare because he was very tough. Nobody dared to contradict him for fear they might lose their job. People were genuinely afraid of him.

I heard many people had a hard time working with him. Were you on good terms with him?

Yes, I did my best to stay in his good books, because I needed this job. And I was lucky I didn't have that much contact with him myself.

They're doing a full investigation so I suppose a lot of these stories are going to come to light.

I hope so. I really hope he's not coming back.

### Stationary Shop

Hello, what can I do for you?

Hello, I'd like to buy some notebooks.

What kind of notebooks would you like, composition or spiral?

I don't like spiral notebooks, because the spirals get all messed up. So I'd like two composition notebooks.

Lined notebooks or blank pages? What do you prefer?

Lined notebooks with margin, please.

What size do you need?

I need A5 size.

Okay, I have these ones in good quality paper and plastic cover. They are $5 each.

They look good, I'll take them.

Okay, do you need anything else?

I would also like a set of blue gel ballpoint pens, a pack of five pencils, a pack of printer paper, a set of washable markers and a pair of scissors. Can you please tell me how much is that set of highlighters over there?

It's $5.

It's not expensive, so I'll take that, too.

That'll be $85.

There you go.

### Jewelry Store

Hello. How may I help you? Sir?

I'm looking for a birthday present for my wife. Can you recommend something?

I think a necklace would be a great choice for such an occasion.

That sounds like a very good idea. I would like something simple, nothing too fancy.

How about these necklaces over here?

I don't think these would fit her style. They're too sophisticated. Do you have more designs?

Yes, we have this gold necklace with the circular pendant or this silver necklace with a little heart.

This is exactly what I'm looking for. How much is it?

Well, it's usually priced at $199. But you're lucky. Today, it's 20% off.

Wonderful. I'll take it. And can you also recommend something for my 7 year old daughter?

Sure, how about this headband? It's $15.

I think she would love it. I'll take it.

Okay, do you need anything else?

No, that's all, thank you.

All right, I'll ring them up at the cash register for you.

------

### Boutique

Excuse me. I'd like to try this blouse on. Can you show me where the fitting room is?

It's at the back, right next to the dresses. Please follow me.

Okay, thank you.

Does it fit you?

No, it's too large actually, do you have it in a smaller size? I need extra small.

I'll go check. I'll be right back. Here you are, extra small.

Thank you. 

Is this one okay?

Yes, it fits perfectly and I love the style. It also matches a skirt I’ve just bought. How much is it?

It's $29.

That's quite an affordable price for such a high quality blouse.

Yes, it's a stylish blouse, made with soft, light weight material. It's a great choice for the hot summer days. We offer fashion and quality at the best price.

Can I pay by credit card?

Yes, of course.

------

### What to Wear

Allison, I don't know what to wear at Melanie's party. It's going to be a house party. So I need a cool casual outfit.

It shouldn't be that difficult. You have so many stylish and trendy clothes.

But I don't know what to choose and how to match them for the best look. I was thinking of wearing this pleated skirt I bought last week. What do you think about it?

I think it's out of fashion, and it's too long and large. It doesn't suit you. It makes you look uncool.

I guess you're right. Maybe it was the wrong choice.

What do you say about this high-waisted jeans skirt? It's actually very trendy, because high waist is in style now.

You think so?

Definitely, we can add this big buckle belt.

Okay, what else shall I put on?

Let's pair it with this cropped, long-sleeve white top. It looks great. I love this blouse because it features that big sleeve trend. This layered necklace pairs perfectly with the top too.

What a wonderful idea. It matches my new shoes.

You look smashing.

------

### Shoe Store

Hi, I saw your shoe clearance sale ad on the flyer.

Yeah, we're offering discounts on all our shoes.

It's the best chance to buy your favorite shoes at a low price. What are you interested in buying?

I need some comfortable shoes for running. Which shoes would be most suitable?

In my opinion, these sneakers would be best for your needs. They're great for running lots of miles, and they're very comfortable.

I like their design. How much are these sneakers?

Their regular price is $150, but they're on sale for 50% off right now.

Really? Let me try them on. Do you have a size eight?

Let me see, here you are. You can go for a walk around the store.

They're soft and comfortable. They slide off and on easily. They fit me well. I'll buy them.

Great. I'll pack them up for you and you can pay at the cash register.

Thank you for your help.

You're very welcome.

### I've lost my glasses

Excuse me, but I've lost my glasses somewhere in this store about an hour ago. I came back to search for them, but couldn't find them. Can you help me?

Sure thing, where exactly do you think you left them?

I left them at the sunglasses counter. I was trying on sunglasses, that's why I took them off. They have quite narrow lenses.

So, small lenses then.

Right, and the rectangular shaped, not round.

And are the frames thick or thin?

Very thin, and their color is black. I hope someone turns them in, because I really need them.

So they’re eyeglasses with thin black frames and rectangular lenses. And you last saw them at the sunglasses counter.

That's right.

All right. Leave me your phone number and I'll call you if someone turns them in.

### Car Center

Hello there. How can I help you today?

I'm looking to upgrade to a bigger car today. My wife and I are expecting our third child, and we need a bit more space now.

I completely understand. Are you thinking of a car or an SUV? Or are you interested in a van?

I think we would like an SUV, but one that isn't too big. And we prefer something with decent gas mileage.

We have a new hybrid SUV that might be great for your family. Take a look.

This is really nice.

It has leather interior, a back-up camera, video screens for the kids and optional third-row seating. 

Very nice. How's the gas mileage?

It gets about 40 miles per gallon.

That's incredible. That's better than my current car. How much is it?

The price is $40000. Would you like to try it out?

Definitely.

Let's take it for a test drive.

What do you think?

It was great. A smooth ride and very comfortable.

We have some great financing deals going on right now.

Sounds good to me. Let's talk out the details.

Awesome. Let's head to my office.

### Car Service

Good morning. What can I do for you?

My car is making a weird noise.

Tell me about the noise. Is it squeaking? Rumbling? Knocking?

It's more like a squeaking.

And when does it generally happen?

It tends to happen when I'm stopping.

I'm going to take your car for a quick diagnostic test to see if I can determine what is causing the sound.

Great. Thanks.

It looks like you need new brakes. The brake pads are worn down, so every time you stop, the metal from the brakes causes a loud noise. I can put new ones on today if you'd like.

That would be great. Thank you.

I also noticed that your oil needs changed and your spark plugs need replacing. Would you like me to take care of those as well?

I might as well fix everything while I'm here.

I'll get everything running smoothly for you. And I'll even run it through the car wash when I'm done.

Thank you so much. It looks and sounds like a brand-new car.

You're very welcome.

### Bakery Shop

It smells delicious in here.

It sure does. It's making me hungry.

Good morning, would you guys like to try one of our famous cupcakes today?

That sounds amazing. But we are here to order a cake.

Wonderful. What kind of cake will you be ordering? Are you celebrating a special occasion?

We are. It's our wedding cake. 

Congratulations. That's so exciting.

We heard you make the best cakes in the area, so we thought we would order it from you.

Well, thank you. I appreciate it. And I know you won't be disappointed. When is the big day?

August 28.

And how many people are you expecting?

We're inviting 100 people, but we assume about 80 of them will actually attend.

Fantastic. And do you have any flavors in mind?

I love chocolate, and Alison loves vanilla. So we aren't sure what to order.

How about we do multiple layers? Some can be chocolate, and some can be vanilla.

I love that idea.

Me, too.

Is buttercream icing okay?

Yes, we both love buttercream icing.

Perfect. Do you want to sample some cake just to make sure you like it?

Yes, please. That sounds like a great idea.

Here you go. One vanilla sample and one chocolate sample.

My goodness, this is delicious.

So good. It melts in your mouth.

Thank you. So I guess this means you're good with your choices?

Definitely.

And what about a design? Do you have anything in mind?

We were thinking some pink roses, pearls and ribbons in the icing.

Sounds great to me. I’ll draw up a design, and we can get the order placed.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

I've been dying to try this place.

Me, too. It smells so good. I've heard their food is fresh, healthy and tasty.

I love the decor. It's elegant and traditional.

Hello. I'm Anna. And I'll be taking care of you both today. Can I start you off with some drinks? We have herbal tea, coffee and a variety of soft drinks.

I'll have a peppermint tea, please.

And I'll have a coffee with cream and sugar.

I'll go grab your drinks and give you a chance to look over the menu.

Everything on the menu looks delicious.

I know I'm not sure what to order. I can't make up my mind.

Here are your drinks, are you ready to order?

This is our first time here. Do you have any favorite dishes you would recommend?

I love the Cobb salad and the grilled chicken sandwich. They are two of our most popular items.

What exactly is Cobb salad?

Romaine lettuce topped with fresh avocado, bacon, egg, tomato, blue cheese and ranch dressing.

Sounds interesting.

Do you want to get the Cobb salad and I'll get the sandwich? Then we can share both.

Great idea. One Cobb salad and one grilled chicken sandwich, please.

Perfect. Your order will be served in a few minutes.

### Hair Salan

Hello. Stephanie.

Hi. Tara. It's so good to see you.

Good to see you, too. How have you been?

Busy as usual. And you?

Same here. I'm way overdue for a haircut.

What are we going to do today? Just a trim? Or something more dramatic?

Actually, I think I want a change. I want to have a trendy look. I'm considering a short bob style. I don't want long wavy hair anymore. I want short straight hair.

That would look great on you. We would need to cut off about 6 inches. Are you okay with that?

You bet. I'm so ready for something different.

And what about color? Are we keeping with your usual blond highlights?

I'm not sure. I was thinking of going with something a little darker.

How about we dye it completely brunette? What do you think?

Not quite. I'd prefer a brown color.

Okay, let's do it. Let's start with the shampoo. Is the water too hot?

Nope, it feels good.

And now let's put in some conditioner. We're ready for the cut.

I'm so excited for this new style.

Me too. I think it will fit you perfectly.

It's so stylish. I love it.

I'm glad you like it. You look fantastic.

Thank you.

You're very welcome.

### Barbershop

Hello there. What can I do for you today?

I'd like a cut and a shave, please.

Not a problem. Let's start with a quick shampoo.

Okay, sounds good.

And now on to the cut. What is your usual style?

I usually wear it a little longer on the top, but pretty short everywhere else.

Okay and which way do you normally part it?

To the right.

Let's get started. What do you think?

Looks good.

And now for the shave, any special requests? Would you like me to leave a goatee for you? Or a mustache?

No, thanks. I'm ready for my face to be smooth again. That looks great. I look like a whole new man. Thanks. What do I owe you?

That'll be $15.

Here's 20, keep the change.

Thanks.

### Gym One

Hello.

Hello, how can I help you?

Can you please tell me how much the membership fee at this gym is?

It's 35 dollars per month. If you choose to pay annually, you'll only need to pay $350.

That sounds good. What are your opening hours?

We open at 5 am and close at midnight.

Do you have personal trainers?

Sure we do. We can show you what to do, how to do it and why you're doing it. Have you worked with a personal trainer before?

No, I haven't.

For your first classes we'll assign you one of our expert personal trainers. Nutrition advice is included in the plan.

That's a very good deal.

Yes, it is. If you want to continue with your trainer after the first few classes, it costs extra though.

I see, okay, I'd like to apply for a gym membership. I'll sign up for a month.

Great. Please fill out this application form.

### Gym Two

I'm so pumped for this workout today.

I'm still sore from our last workout. What are we doing today?

You're going to love it. First we will lift weights. Then we will take an aerobics class. And we will end with some yoga stretches.

That sounds like a lot. I thought we were going to run outside today.

We're gonna run outside later today.

Are you serious? I don't think I'll have any energy left for that.

Of course you will. Don't worry. So let's start with the weights.

I think 3 days a week at the gym is too much for me.

If you want to build muscles, resistance and strength, you need to stick to the gym. We're building up good habits at the same time, I need to lose some weight too.

Nutrition is also important, if you want to lose weight. If you start eating healthy food, you'll be surprised how easy it is to lose weight.

I agree, we need to make some changes in our diet, too. We can fuel up with some healthy fruits and veggies after we finish our workout. It's time for our aerobics class. Let's go.

### Flower Shop

Hello.

Hello, sir. Are you looking for anything special today?

Yes, I'd like to get my wife some flowers. It's our anniversary today.

Well, happy anniversary. How many years have you been married?

5 years.

That's great. Well, I have several options for you. Does your wife have a favorite type of flower?

She loves roses and daisies. But she really likes any type of flower.

You could go the traditional romantic route and get her a dozen red roses.

I thought about that, but I think I'd like something a little more creative and unique.

I do have some bouquets that combine a few roses with some other seasonal choices.

That sounds like something she might like.

This one here has pink roses, but also spring tulips and calla lilies. And it comes with this beautiful vase.

That looks great. How much is it?

$100.

That one is a little out of my budget. Do you have anything in the fifty-dollar range?

Of course. We have this vase full of pink and yellow roses for 49 dollars. Or this vase for 40 dollars. It doesn't include any roses. But it has other gorgeous flowers. It really brightens up the room, don't you think?

That bouquet looks indeed unique. I think my wife would really enjoy it. I'll take it.

Perfect. I'll put the vase in a sturdy box for you so you can get them home safely.

Thank you.

### Library

Hello. 

Hello. What can I help you with today?

I'd like to apply for a library card.

Yes, sure. Do you have proof of residence? A driver's license or something showing that you live in this city.

Yes, here you go.

Thank you, now please fill out this application.

Okay, all done.

All right, now please sign the back of the card. Okay, you're all set. Here is your card.

Thank you.

Now you can go and look for the books you want to read. Then you must come here to sign them out. You can only checkout three books at a time, and you can also use a computer to look up for any book. There is also a reading area where you can sit and read a book.

I see, can you please tell me where the Fiction section is?

Yes, it's in the rear left corner of the library.

Thank you very much for your help.

It's been a crazy few days of moving and unpacking.

Would you and your family like to come over for a cookout tonight? Nothing fancy.
Just some hot dogs and burgers.
We could introduce our voice to each other and introduce our husbands as well.
What do you think?
Thank you so much.
We would love that.
It will be a funny evening for all of us.
